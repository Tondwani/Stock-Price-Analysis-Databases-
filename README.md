# Stock-Price-Analysis-Databases-
Project Overview
I've always been curious about how companies monitor and track their stock prices in the market. This curiosity led me to develop a Stock Price Analysis & Database Management System, a project designed to collect, analyze, and visualize stock data for multiple companies. This system allows users to store historical stock prices, analyze trends, and generate meaningful insights through various statistical methods and visualizations.

This project consists of four key components:

collect_data.py: A script that gathers stock data from the market using an API.
data_analysis.py: A script that processes and analyzes stock price data using statistical techniques.
generate_report.py: A module that generates a summary report of stock performance, volatility, and strategy results.
visualization.py: A module for plotting stock data, including price movements and performance of various strategies, such as moving averages.
The system uses an SQLite database (stock_data.db) to store stock prices and other relevant information.

Features
Data Collection: Fetches historical stock price data from a reliable data source.
Database Storage: Stores stock prices in an SQLite database for easy querying and management.
Technical Analysis: Implements basic analysis techniques, including moving averages and volatility calculations.
Backtesting Strategies: Includes a moving average crossover strategy for backtesting historical performance.
Visualization: Generates graphs for buy-and-hold returns, strategy performance, and volatility.
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for data collection, analysis, and visualization.
SQLite: Database to store stock price data.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For generating visualizations of stock data.
yfinance: Python package for retrieving stock market data.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run the project, you need to install the following libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install yfinance
Running the Project
Collect Stock Data
Use the collect_data.py file to collect stock prices from the market and store them in an SQLite database.

bash
Copy code
python collect_data.py
This script will fetch the stock data and save it to the stock_data.db file.

Analyze the Data
Use the data_analysis.py file to perform statistical analysis on the stock data, such as moving averages and volatility calculations.

bash
Copy code
python data_analysis.py
Generate a Report
Use the generate_report.py script to summarize stock performance, strategy returns, and volatility.

bash
Copy code
python generate_report.py
Visualize the Data
The visualization.py file creates graphical representations of the stock prices and the results of the trading strategies.

bash
Copy code
python visualization.py
You will see a chart showing stock performance and strategy results.

Example Output
The output will include:
A populated SQLite database with stock prices.
Statistical analysis such as moving averages and volatility.
A summary report showing the overall performance of your strategy.
Visualizations of stock price trends and strategy results.
Future Improvements
Add more sophisticated strategies like RSI, Bollinger Bands, or MACD.
Implement a real-time data stream for up-to-date stock prices.
Build a web interface to interact with the analysis and visualizations more easily.
